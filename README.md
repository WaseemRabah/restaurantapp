# Design

## Agile Strategy
The Agile methodology was used to plan and create this project. I used the Projects tool within GitHub to manage the different processes needed for this project to be completed.
You can see the project created [here](https://github.com/users/WaseemRabah/projects/2/views/1)

- User Stories were created through GitHub Issues to highlight features for possible implementation.
- These User Stories were then assigned a label from these options - 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have'. These labels helped to prioritise which features needed to be implemented first.

After completing this project I saw the capability to use Epics (GitHub Milestones). These can give User Stories an overall theme to a group of User Stories - this is a feature within GitHub that I will research and use in future projects as I wasn't aware of this until after completing this project.

## Testing

## Deployment

I deployed the app using the website Heroku, which hosts internet applications.

I used ElephantSQL to set up a free cloud database with them. Set up an account with ElephantSQL and then follow these steps.
- Click Create New Instance to create a new database.
![Deployment ElephantSQL](/documentation/sql1.png)
- Choose your location and name.
![Deployment ElephantSQL 2](/documentation/sql2.png)
- Finalise setup
- Copy over your URL and add this to your application IDE in your env.py, remember to keep this secret.
![Deployment ElephantSQL 3](/documentation/sql3.webp)

Set up an account with Heroku, then follow these steps for deployment -
- Create an app
- Name the app
- Connect the app to GitHub and find the repository which you'd like to connect with.
- Head over to the settings tab and find the Config Vars. Add the config vars appropriate to the app. In this case, it is PORT, ALLOWED_HOSTS, SECRET_KEY, CLOUDINARY_URL and DATABASE_URL.
![Deployment Heroku](/documentation/heroku1.png)
- **Before your final deployment you must set DEBUG = False within your IDE, so to make sure that your code is safe and the site works as intended with any 404 pages working correctly. Once this has been make, you can make your final `push` to your GitHub Repository**
- Switch back to the Deploy tab and half way down the page you can select automatic deploys. When this is active, whenever a new edit is received by GitHub, Heroku also updates the application and builds a new deployment. Once this has been checked, click the deploy branch button at the bottom and await for the domain URL to be generated.

- The database was deployed to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
